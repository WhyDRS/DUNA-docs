# Biweekly Meetings

We currently have two weekly meetings held [in our Discord](https://mee6.xyz/i/xyGz2buGJR) based on an availability poll.
You can join all discussions (which are recorded) in the Discord event meeting channel.

## Wednesdays

8pm ET / 1am GMT

## Sundays

1pm ET / 6pm GMT

## Taking Stock

We also host a weekly podcast, [Taking Stock](duna/podcasts.md), on the [@whydrs](https://x.com/whydrs) X account. The format allows for roughly an hour of engaged discussion between hosts and invited guests before opening the floor for contribution and question from live listeners. All are welcome to join discussion.
