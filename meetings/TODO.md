# Pending notes

Here are some notes I took from the meeting yesterday as well: 

@Gorillionaire2  would like to focus on the back end of the Database and resources, rather than the front end, so if we could find some more community members to assist with front end development and acclimate to GitHub it would be a big help. 

@NYTEMODE and @Jersan  , your names were brought up that seem to have the skills. Are you two interested? ðŸ™‚

New Repo procedure-  set up a new issue within WhyDRS checking for community agreement, then create new repo. For RNN Repo, issues are used to track articles in progress and sources, then â€˜completedâ€™ when the article can be published. @Altair @WeAreTheDerelictCats @bobmahalo  , would love to assist to  onboard and consider article/issue development. Maybe we transition existing articles to a new host within WhyDRS.

Need to review the contribution standards on the github to make sure that the free and open contributions can exist while also discouraging that the organization sponsors or agrees with that bad behavior or bad faith discussion. Above example, Bob mentioned Heather Cox Anderson had to deal with a lot of live pornography during her livestreams on Meta. 

For Meta Channel in Discord- Transition to weekly meetings, add a politics channel, should there be a GitHub repo for the Discord? (include: links out to bots, suggestion for improvement?), TTS Bot added so that people can text in and have easier input (like Moonfire)

Discussed a registry of github users, which would allow for more nuanced breakdown of permissions structure vs membership which is binary. A registry could also include what skills a person has, what they help with, what they have commented on.
